**Parse DJI Drone SRT Files into a Useful Object.**

Simply refer to `example_usage.py` and follow the instructions.

You can install it using:

```bash
pip install dji-drone-data
```

Warning: Unfortunately, there is no bearing, speed, or camera gimbal data included. It's disappointing and a bit of a hassle, but you may need to consider using air data to fill in these gaps.
